Dear candidate, 

I'm sending you the exercise following our conversation â€¦ 

Please complete the following exercise within 2 hours: (You may ask for another 1 hour depends on the level of achievement after 2 hours) 

 

Read all of the steps before you start: 

Connect to the server 34.245.97.156 , using the attached key and ubuntu username (You may have the application running only on this one) 

Use github as your code version control, the repository URL you will have to use is (Fork it): https://github.com/JacobT2K/DevOpsEx106.git (Exercise appears within the README file as well) 

Clone the git repo under the folder /git 

Setup a docker environment on that server to have 2 containers (1st python app, 2nd MongoDB) 

MongoDB database name will be 'words' 

MongoDB Collection name will be 'word' 

Write a python application that responds to 2 APIs 

API 1 = Should be a REST API to allow writing of a specific value to the DB (Can be any API type, GET, PUT etc.) 

API 2 = Must be a GET REST API to show the current values from the MongoDB 

BONUS: Deploy the application using Jenkins from a 3rd container on the same docker 

 

Please note: if you have difficulties with 1 or more steps, try to overcome that obstacle by an alternative of your own. (This is not recommended, but the most important part is to complete the exercise) 

Good luck :)
